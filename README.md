## Situation
The Palacegreen Sales Performance Dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), including total transactions, quantity sold, costs, revenue, customer segmentation and profit. 
The companyâ€™s goal is to identify trends, optimize sales performance, and uncover actionable insights to enhance profitability and improve decision-making.
This analysis presents a clear picture of sales data, demonstrating the use of data analytics in driving business insights for better decision-making, providing insight into the sales performance across various dimensions, 
including transactions, profit by region, and customer demographics.

## Task
As a data analyst, my role was to assess the dashboard's metrics, analyze performance trends, and recommend data-driven strategies to address performance gaps, optimize profitability, and identify high-performing areas for targeted improvements.

## Action
Evaluated metrics such as revenue, costs, and profits to uncover strengths and areas for improvement.
Assessed profit trends by year and determined that there was a clear rise in profitability from January 2015 through mid-2016, peaking around mid-2016 and a decline thereafter.
Compared performance across states, identifying Lagos leading with profits exceeding $0.40M and Abuja as top-performing locations, while states like Edo and Borno underperformed. 
Analyzed age and gender contributions to profitability, identifying adults generating around $1.20M and youth as the primary profit drivers and noted near-equal profit contributions from male (52%) and female (48%) customers.
Reviewed product categories, noting Phones as the highest revenue generator, with Accessories and Clothing showing potential for optimization.
Suggested actionable steps to improve profitability, including targeted campaigns, pricing adjustments, and seasonal strategy optimization.
The dashboard allows filtering by Salesperson, Payment Option, Customer Age Group, and Customer Type (High, Low, Medium value). This interactive feature enables deeper insights into performance across different dimensions.

## Recommendations
Expanding operations, marketing, or promotions in the top-performing states could further boost revenue.
The company should target the adults and youth age groups with personalized marketing, loyalty programs etc in order to maximize sales and increase profit
The underperformance in the Aged and Elder categories shoud be further evaluated to determine if there are opportunities to create age-specific products or offers.
The Profit margin stands at $2.26M from a $22.34M revenue, which is around 10%. The company should negotiate better terms with suppliers to reduce costs, optimize inventory management and reduce any operational inefficiencies 
that may be driving up costs in order to enhance profitability.
